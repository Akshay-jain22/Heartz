    Hindi = translateText("Good morning friends. Welcome to Aware Computers. In last video we discussed about applications of computers. In this video I am going to explain about black diagram of computer. What is the black diagram of computer? So the black diagram of computer is also called as essential components of computers. So on the basis of computers, hardware and depending on the computer's work, the computer is divided into the following types. So first of all, on the base of computer hardware. What is hardware? Hardware means what we can touch and feel. It is called hardware. So keyboard, mouse, printer, these are all things called hardware. On the base of computers, computers work. The computer is divided into the following types. Those are CPU, central processing unit, input, output memory or storage unit. Coming to the black diagram of computer, see the black diamond of computer, how it looks like. So first of all input. After then, CPU contains three parts control unit, memory, automatic logic unit. After then in the downside, secondary memory or storage unit, outside output unit. So these are all things will be involved in the black diagram of computer. So we'll discuss very clearly coming to CPU central processing unit. CPU is also called as heart of the computer or brain of the computer. And CPU is divided into the following types. Those are control unit, cu, automatic logic unit, Alu and primary memory. So CPU is divided into the following types. Those are Alu primary memory. So we will discuss about cu control unit. Control unit is used to control and manage all the components of the computer system. And also it takes care of step by step processing of all operations processed by the computers. And also it is user to decide in operations which instructions will be executed first after then coming to Alu. Alu stands for automatic logic unit. It performs all automatic operations like additions, subtractions, multiplications et cetera. It is also called as digital logic unit. So here you also called as what? Digital logic unit. It takes the data from the input and performs the calculations and send the data to the control unit or memory. So this is about Alu coming to primary memory. Primary memory is also called volatile memory or temporary memory or main memory. It stores the data very less time. Whenever power failures computers crash, restart of the computer, then the data will be lost. Examples of primary memory is Ram under Roam. Ram stands for Random access memory. Roam stands for read only memory coming to secondary memory or storage unit. Secondary memory is also called as permanent memory or non volatile memory. Primary memory called as what? Temporary memory. It is secondary memory is permanent memory. Secondary memory source the data permanently. But what about primary memory? It stores data for the less time. That is temporary time. That means any systems crash, restart of the computer, power failure, the data will be lost in primary memory. But in secondary memory the data will be stored in permanently so it never lost data whenever power failures and the system crashes, et cetera. Examples of secondary memory is CD stands for what? Compact disk, floppy disk, DVD, pendrives, et cetera. Coming to Input what is input? So, instructions to the computer whatever instructions we give the computer, those instructions are called input. Instructions to the computer is called input. Using some devices we can give instructions to the computers. So if you want to give some instructions to the computer, we can use some devices. What are they? These devices are called input devices. The input devices are keyboard, mouse, gist, stylus, et cetera. Coming to Output so first of all, if you want to give any input to the computer after then compulsory, it has to give some result. So the result is also called as output. That means what is output? That means result of input is called an output. So whatever instructions we give the computer immediately, it will give some result. The result is called an output. Using some devices we can get output from the computer. The output device are monitor, printer, plotter, etc. If you like this video, please like share subscribe our channel.", "hindi")
